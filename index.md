A language for build modern applications 

## Motivation

Arbor is a language that is meant to make it easy to build modern applications in. It is a semi functional language inspired primarily by [Golang](https://golang.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and vaguley by [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/). Arbor Compiles into [Web Assembly](https://webassembly.org/) which enables it to be run in the browser or via the Arbor Virtual Machine.

## The Arbor Virtual Machine

The Arbor Virtual Machine is based off of [the Life Virtual Machine](https://github.com/perlin-network/life). It is written in GoLang from top to bottom. All extensions and a lot of the Standard Library is written in GoLang.
